## CS-Cart Boilerplate Addon v3.0

This addon provides a basic structure, template, and other necessary features to roll a CS-Cart addon v3.0. If you are new or curious about module building for CS-Cart, you can use this repo as a boilerplate. If you are a dev and have more ideas for feature templates, please submit a pull :)

Obviously, this addon does nothing until you replace all instances of `example_addon` and its attributes with your own, then add your desired code. But as it stands, learning/adding your code is easier because of:

### Feature Examples
- A pre-formatted addon.xml and language.po file
- Structure for function, script, and controller
- Example TPL script hooks for admin and catalog
- Enable/disable addon setting, per-storefront
- Install/uninstall DB procedures for a Y/N product field
- Option to abort uninstall DB proceedure

### Future things
- TBA - Appending to addon tab in product, store, etc
- TBA - Simple block schema, settings, and tpl
- TBA - Product admin global + mass edit
